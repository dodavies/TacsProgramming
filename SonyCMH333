Sony CMH-333 Cellular Telephone

There seem to be two types of cmh-333's out there, with two different NAM
programming sequences. One is the marsbar.txt (old method),so called because
I had it before the cmh-333.txt (new one).
To change the ESN, there is a program by The Cheese Factory that requires a
cable to be built. 

Here's a diagram of the cable required:

The end of the cable that connects the phone is a bit tricky. I myself have a
load of little PCBs that slot into the correct part of the phone and I solder
the wires onto this every time I make a cable up. If you know me personally
I can sort you out with an end, if not they're easy enough to make up on a 
PCB machine, and if you're _really_ stupid you can buy the cables at next to
nothing prices out of Exchange & Mart or something these days.

Value of Resistor R = 10k
Numbers in square brackets represent Pin number on D-Plug (-> Printer Port)

The large squares represent the top and underside of the phone end of the 
cable. You should have a small PCB with 7 contacts at the end (represented
by  |  in the diagram above).

As you can see I was never any good at ASCII diagrams...

That should set you on your way.
