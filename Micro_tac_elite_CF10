Part Two
MicroTac Eleet Battery Connector features a new external connector which is
functionally very similar to earlier MicroTac connectors, and now includes
an external RF connection.  The pinout of the MicroTac Elite external 
connector is as follows:

      \              \

   The RF level at this point                         Pin 10.. battery feedback
   is approx. 2db lower than the level
   at the antenna.


The battery connector is fully compatible with all previous models.
Also includes a fourth terminal which senses battery information from E+P 
batteries.  There is no longer a recessed manual test connection at the 
battery connector block since that function is now part of the external
connector.
**NOTE**
The manual test pin is now located in the EXTERNAL CONNECTOR and NOT at the
battery connector block!  MicroTac Elite phones may be placed in test mode
by grounding the manual test pin during power-up, just like other Mot. 
models.  Use caution when placing the phone into test mode or damage could
occur to the external connector.  Manual test mode commands are the same
as previous models.
