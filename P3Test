Useful information that relates to the modified test chip avalible for the 
NEC P3 mobile phones (May not cover all avalible commands).

Please note: The contents of this entire document are for informational 
purposes only and must not be used to break any laws, if you use any of 
this information you are soley responceable for you own actions. OK!

Here are some of the new and most useful commands.
==================================================

To enter the phone's serial number and phone number.
----------------------------------------------------
Power On, Enter ESN (11 digits) on keypad then STO 69, the phone should 
now switch back to the display. (DO NOT enter eleven 0's sto 69, this will 
disable the phone completely and beyond normal reset, can be useful <grin>).
Note: If you ever need to use the eleven 0's then don't throw your phone
away as there still are ways to reset it.

Then press RCL *, RCL # 01 (test mode entered), RCL #71 and the phone 
number will appear. Just enter the new phone number.
i.e. providers code (4 digits) and then number (6 digits). 

The provider code translations are as follows; 
(please add to this list and re-upload this document, thanks).

(0374) = 2345 (VodaFone) System A.
(0378) = 2343 (VodaFone) System A.
(0831) = 2344 (VodaFone) System A.
(0836) = 2340 (VodaFone) System A.
-----------------------------------
(0585) = 2349 (Cellnet) System B.
(0850) = 2346 (Cellnet) System B.
(0860) = 2342 (Cellnet) System B.

Press # for the rest of the phone menu or just to ensure that the number has 
been stored. The only other item that needs to be changed is SYS=A or B. 
You can also change the real numbers prefix, but this is only for "real" 
number display purposes on the function command. i.e. FCN 33 will display 
0836-XXXXXX or whatever, but the phone's number according to the cell 
system is really 2340-XXXXXX. You may also wish to play with the other 
settings, but please note the originals before doing so. 

Once you have altered all of your settings, (note pressing # stores the
setting, and moves to the next) press and hold CLR once the display is
blank, press RCL # 02 to reboot the phone. Alternatively, you can just
press PWR to turn it off, and PWR to turn it back on.

Any further information on these extra options will be appreciated. 
(Please note them here and re-upload this document).

The lock code is obviously just the phone's lock code, however, it doesn't
serve much good with a modified P3 rom, since one can jump into test mode
from full lock! And then change the lock code....(You must enter test mode
by pulling out the battery, and quickly putting it back in.)

Home area has many possible values, however, for the purpose of the general
Cellphone Phreaker, only three are used. If you have a Vodafone ESN^MIN
pair, then enter 02051 here. This essentially means that you can receive
calls on the other person's number.....The other values for home area are
simply to tell the Cell where you live in the country. If you have a
Cellnet ESN^MIN pair, then enter 03600, and if you don't want to receive
calls, enter 00000. Note that if the other person has there phone turned on
at the time that you use yours for incoming calls, then the Cell will
automatically kill the ESN^MIN pair.

Roam is for future use, and will not be used....It is basically for phones
with Dual Nams, so they can use both Cellnet and Vodafone on the same
ESN^MIN pair.

Timer SW. This should always be on Voice CH. This is basically how the Cell
will charge you fo the calls.....Voice CH works on both Cellnet and
VodaFone, but Charge RT only works on Cellnet....This tells you how many
units you have spent (Using FCN 1 menu.)

Priority should basically be set rather high. If your local Cell is busy,
and there are no free cells, and you have a priority of 15, then someone
else will be disconnected, and your call will be allowed!

Call Timer. This serves little for the Cellular Phreaker. It is best to
leave this on Call Out. The function only is significant to those who
actually pay the phone bill!

To make the phone scan all avalible channels (Voice only).
==========================================================
Later in this document will be some test commands, to enter test mode on 
the modified chip you will always need to enter the ESN again, then RCL * 
and RCL #01 for test mode. (NOTE: There is a faster way of entering the test 
mode by simply removing the battery and quicly putting it back, the phone 
will go into test mode.)

To Scan (Once in test mode) press RCL # 12 (Speaker on), RCL # 69 then 4 
digits (channel to start), then # (see this option in test manual text later 
in this document for more details). Use * to pause.

i.e. If you enter 0001 as the channel, the phone will start scanning each 
channel from 1 to 600 and then 1329 to 2047. As soon as you hear voice you
can press * to stay on that channel and * again to move on.

Start of Test Commands.
=======================
These are listed as they are in the test manual, but please note that some
commands may be different or act differently due to the modification on the
chip.

Top of page reads: 147-102650X322A  TR5E1320-22A  APPENDIX A Test commands -
                   - through keypad.

NOTE: Enter each command by pressing RCL key, # key, and the proper command
number. Some commands require additional numbers after a hyphen followed by
the # key.

    RCL, #, Number
    RCL, #, Number, Additional Number, #

When you enter the commands through the keypad, always give SUSPEND command
(RCL, #, 01) before you press other commands except STATUS (RCL, #, 03) and
STATUS REPEAT (RCL. #, 61, 1, #).

Most remark paragraphs start at col 33 unless the Function name is long, then
it will start at 1 or 2 spaces after the Function name. Notice that no chara-

RCL, #, 69      SCAN SLOW       Measure the Received Signal Stength Indicati-
                                -on (RSSI) signal at each channel.
                                Shows each channel number and it's RSSI level
                                on the display.
Example:        ----------      ----------
                TEST  MODE      TEST  MODE     Simply press # key or
                       69-            69-1     press channel number and #.
                ----------      ----------  
                To activate the SCAN SLOW command, press RCL. # 69, XXXX, #.
                Where XXXX = starting channel number (1 through 6000, 1329
                through 2047). If you don't enter the channel number and
                press # key, then the channel will begin from 0001. The unit
                measures the RSSI at each channel, scanning from the channel
                number you set. The scanning speed is 0.5secs per channel.
                The unit shows each channel number and it's RSSI level on
                the display "XXXX-sss" (On Mid line).
                ----------
                TEST  MODE       Where: XXXX = Channel number
                  XXXX-sss               sss = RSSI
                ----------
                Pressing * key while scanning causes the unit to pause.

                Pressing * key again resumes scanning. To end scanning press
                the # key. The radio channel will be fixed at the first 
                channel number and is ready to accept other commands. If you
                press other keys other than the * or # the unit ignores them
                and gives back a short alarm tone.

Note: All information given in this file is from Appendix A of the P3 Test
ROM manual, it is documented as per appendix A apart from the last couple
of remarks under BATT and TEMP (i.e. Fucked! and Fried!) also the last test
code 99 is a load of rubbish, well after writing all this long boring tech
file about a phone that can do everything! I could resist added it! <g>.

In test mode use RCL, #, 98 and take down all the information that pops up
every second. *** Example only, put yours like this below ***.
