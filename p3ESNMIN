Thats all the info you require to program the Nam, the ESN and to make the
cable required. I have included a file on the Test Rom functions
(P3TST002.TXT) which has some other info that is Helpful.

Also included are the programs Read.EXE and Chip.EXE for reading and
programming the P3's ESN!!!!

Some other files which are of use are:-

Fitting Instructions for new Timer Controller ROM.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enclosed you will find chip/s for your Timer Controller system <g>. Take Anti-Static Precautions.


How to fit. 
===========
(You will need at least two watch-maker screwdrivers, a small Philips type and 
a small flat bit. Also you may need a pair of thin nose pliers or tweezers).

Remove any power source to or on the unit etc. Ensure you are static free 
(touch something that is earthed) before handling. Now remove the casing of the unit (if you don't know how to do this and you have the special screws, then
use the pliers or tweezers and slot the two leg ends of these tools into two
opposite sections of the screw then undo anti-clockwise). Now remove the large
metal unit by removing the three small Philips screws plus a coax lead (and
unplug the coax plug).

Now you should be able to see the main PCB and the chip holder with its top and
screen. To remove the holder you will need to raise one edge with the flat bit 
screwdriver and it should pop off. The screen then has to be lifted, however it is OK to cut this part off as the unit works OK without it. Now you have access
to the original chip, to remove this you simply just use the small bit
screwdriver (carefully) and raise one corner (do the other one simultaneously 
if you need to), the chip should now pop out. The markings for the socket and
chips are as follows;

Pin one for the socket is noted by an arrow (triangle) in the middle of the top of the socket (the top of the socket is mounted to the right of the PCB).
Looking down at the PCB with the power compartment at the bottom, the arrow 
will be on the right of the PCB in the middle of the socket. The original chip
has an indicator for pin one underneath it. The new chips have a little hole 
on top of them.

When fitting the new chip/s push them in with even pressure and ensure that the
top is level with the socket (no deeper). They may be a very tight fit, so take
it easy. To remove them just use the screwdriver again to lift the edge and 
then slide it underneath to lift the entire chip (check the pins are OK). To
test the unit simply put it all back together without the screws but ensure 
the coax is reconnected and hold it together whilst testing.
