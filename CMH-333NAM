3) Select the NAM you wish to program by entering 1 or 2 on the
keypad.

five (1-5) programming parameters.

Fu-2 = Full programming mode.  Allows entering all 14 parameters.

4) Select 1 or 2 on the keypad for Abbreviated or Full programming
mode.



Clearing a NAM:

Clearing the NAM results in the seventh digit of the MIN programming
parameter being changed to a line mark.  This is equivalent to there being
no number in the parametr.  All other programming parameters remain the same.
If the NAM is cleared the user will not be allowed access to it by the RCL 5
key sequence.  (refer to the owners manual)

After you have have selected the NAM in programming mode, the display
will read Ab-1 Fu-2.  Press the SEND key.  The display will read
"clear 1" or "clear 2".  The phone will then restart.
