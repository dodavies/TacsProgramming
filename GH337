How to build and use a programming cable for the Ericsson GH337
Also PH337, GH388

This file instructs one on how to build a cable to reprogram the GH337 from a standard
serial port. Much of this info is taken from a file "How to activate built-in calculator 
and RBS-info", author unknown. Use of this cable may violate your phone's warrantee or your 
service agreement. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

There has been a report that there is no calculator available on the PH337.

Connect RS232 to phone via a TTL to RS232 converter.

NOTE! You can NOT connect the RS232 directly to the phone,
      you MUST use a TTL to RS232 converter!
      
        Pin 8   DC GND                           ->  ComPort GND
        Pin 11  RXD (TTL serial data TO phone)   ->  ComPort TXD
        Pin 12  TXD (TTL serial data FROM phone) ->  ComPort RXD

Connect external 5 volts to Pin 9 (FLASH 5/12volts input)
(Pin 6 SWDC5 [5 volts out] to pin 9 may also work, but have not tried it)

Pin 1 is leftmost pin (near Mic), when looking at the front/bottom.

The communications port parameters should be 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and
no parity. Communications speed can be as low as 9600 baud (maybe lower),
but if set for 115200 baud, the phones operations are shown as they are
done (i.e. communicating with RBS, reading SIM, etc.)
 Here's an example:

  From: Dave Plumb <dplumb@cix.compulink.co.uk>
  ----------------------------------------------
  RR_ACT_REQ , PLMN = F432 0003
  MM state 4
  
  Get FCH on ARFCN = 618  Rxlev = -93

  Get SCH on ARFCN = 618
  Old TCXO value 128
  Intermediate TCXO value 128
  New TCXO value 128
  FirstPhaseDiff = 1, SecondPhaseDiff = 1
  ----------------------------------------------

 

Power on phone by pressing "NO/ENDpwr".
When performing its powerup sequence the phone will send two ">>"
(ASCII 62 decimal) characters. Within 1 second, reply to it by
sending the 4 character sequence "TP1<CR>". [ Dr Who's Note: Another
source says TP1:<cr> ]

If everything whent fine you should get the "OK" prompt back.


Test the TEST PROGRAM by sending the commands terminated by a <CR>:

        PROG 0          (shows Test Program product number info)
        PROG 1          (shows Test Program product date info)
        PROG 3          (Shows Main Application product number info)
        PROG D          (Shows Main Application product date info)

EEWR [address] [value]   writes a value to the given address, given in hexadecimal. The 
following functions can be done with this. I am sure there are many more. These functions 
require the phone to be turned off, then on again after this programming.

        EEWR 047A 	01 = enable built-in calculator and RBS info (no
                             calculator on PH337), 00 = disable
	EEWR 045B	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 045C	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 045D	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 045E	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 045F	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 0460	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 0461	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 0462	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 0463	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 0464	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 0465	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 0466	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 1587	00 = disable service provider lock

EERE [address]  reads the contents of a single memory address. Pressing G
several times gets wierd features - these still need to be mapped. (thanks
Nick Ustinov). K returns from this mode

PREA [bank] [address] [bytes-to-read]  displays the contents of the memory starting at 
[address]. The value at the end is the checksum for the bytes read. [bank] can be 00 
through 7F, [address] can be 0000 through BFFF, and [bytes-to-read] can be 0000 through BFFF.
PREA FF returns the checksum of the entire application.
