ESN transfer on Ericsson EH237 & EH238


You can activate the built in ESN transfer mode by entering M&922630. 
This means hold down the 'M' or function button and then entering 922630 
within 10 seconds to activate this mode.

You will need the same serial cable as described at your web site but 
this time, you need reverse the data in and data out pins to the other 
phone.

Whit the keyboard looking up and you looking at the terminals of the 
connector, the terminals are numbered (from left to right) 14 down to 1

Keyboard up

|14           1|    Pin 11 is data from external source
                    Pin 12 is the data to the phone

All data to the phone is at 600 Baud, 8 bits with logic '1' being 4.8V 
and logic '0' being 0 V. This means you need an RS 232 to TTL converter

Pin 9 is used to enable you to program the Flash EEPROM in the phone.
Open is the normal operating mode.
+5V is test mode
+12 is Programming mode for ESN's and software changes etc.

Pin 8 is the necessary digital ground for doing anything.

There is yet another test code you can experiment with from the keyboard.

Just enter M& 90510# and the unit will display the overhead message and 
status of the phone.

Have fun !
