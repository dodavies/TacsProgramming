How to build and use a programming cable for the Ericsson GH388

This file instructs one on how to build a cable to reprogram the GH337 from a standard
serial port. Much of this info is taken from a file "How to activate built-in calculator 
and RBS-info", author unknown. Use of this cable may violate your phone's warrantee or your 
service agreement. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Connect RS232 to phone via a TTL to RS232 converter.

[Dr Who's Note: It occurs to me that some older computers, such as the 
Commodore 64, use TTL levels already, so no conversions is neccessary with
them. It remains to be seen, however, if they can successfully do 9600 bps]

NOTE! You can NOT connect the RS232 directly to the phone,
      you MUST use a TTL to RS232 converter!
      
        Pin 8   DC GND                           ->  ComPort GND
        Pin 11  RXD (TTL serial data TO phone)   ->  ComPort TXD
        Pin 12  TXD (TTL serial data FROM phone) ->  ComPort RXD

Connect external 5 volts to Pin 9 (FLASH 5/12volts input)
(Pin 6 SWDC5 [5 volts out] to pin 9 may also work, but have not tried it)

Pin 1 is leftmost pin (near Mic), when looking at the front/bottom.

The communications port parameters should be 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and
no parity. Communications speed can be as low as 9600 baud (maybe lower),
but if set for 115200 baud, the phones operations are shown as they are
done (i.e. communicating with RBS, reading SIM, etc.)
 Here's an example, from a GH-337, does the GH-388 display the same info?

Power on phone by pressing "NO/ENDpwr".
When performing its powerup sequence the phone will send &quot;2&quot;.
Within 1 second, reply to it by sending the 2 character sequence "0B". 
The computer will respond "R". At this time, you must send it the sequence 
contained in this file <a href="jumpserv.bin">jumpserv.bin</a>. The phone 
will respond "SP, OK", and the computer should display "R".

WARNING! There have been suggestions that reading to and writing from certain
locations in memory (specifically the IMEI and SPCK locations) will erase the
phones EEPROM! Be Careful!

Test the TEST PROGRAM by sending the commands terminated by a <CR>:
 (These are for the GH-337, do they work on the 388?)
        PROG 0          (shows Test Program product number info)
        PROG 1          (shows Test Program product date info)
        PROG 3          (Shows Main Application product number info)
        PROG D          (Shows Main Application product date info)

EEWE [address] [value]   writes a value to the given address, given in hexadecimal. The 
following functions can be done with this. I am sure there are many more. These functions 
require the phone to be turned off, then on again after this programming.

        EEWE 03EE 	01 = enable built-in calculator and RBS info. 00 = disable
	EEWE 03CF	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWE 03D0	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWE 03D1	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWE 03D2	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWE 03D3	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWE 03D4	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWE 03D5	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWE 03D6	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWE 03D7	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWE 03D8	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWE 03D9	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations
	EEWR 03DA	00 = disable electronic lock, place 00 in all these locations

EERE [address]  [number-of-bytes] reads the contents of a single memory address.
Pressing G several times gets wierd features - these still need to be mapped. 
K returns from this mode

PREA is from the GH-337 - does this work on the 388?
PREA [bank] [address] [bytes-to-read]  displays the contents of the memory starting at 
[address]. The value at the end is the checksum for the bytes read. [bank] can be 00 
through 7F, [address] can be 0000 through BFFF, and [bytes-to-read] can be 0000 through BFFF.
PREA FF returns the checksum of the entire application.

LIME - List IMEI. WARNING! There are rumors that this will disable the phone!

There is a way to flash the EEPROM, but a special sequence is needed to 
do this. When I get it I will place it on this page.
